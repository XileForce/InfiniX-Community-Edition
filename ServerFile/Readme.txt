WARNING:
The new server.jar (Forge.jar) requires the vanilla mc server.jar in the same folder! do not rename the vanilla jar! Make sure to launch the forge jar, it will detect the vanilla server.jar unless you rename it! 

The Viper Script is an optimized startup script that is only good if you have a lot of ram to throw at the server, and are running the Java 8 JDK! using the JRE will not yield the same results. This was tested extensively and proven to give the best performance results in profiling! Make sure to adjust the ram settings in it for your server!
